title: My Political Reform Agenda
---

When someone with integrity attains the White House, I want a full accounting of
all the funds stolen from the American people by corrupt "appointees" and cronies
of the ORANGE CORRUPTION and his party. I want those monies RETURNED and those
criminals imprisoned.

Then I want a full trace of all the monies siphoned out of the US into shelters
overseas and I want those returned to the people

Then I want a full accounting of all contracts let by the gov, with pricing and
money flow review / audit esp. to ties of those in office

Then I want a full review & restoration of bills ILLEGALLY repealed by a corrupt
government

Then I want to institute a maximum 100:1 Top:Bottom pay band; to be reviewed and
adjusted as we learn more

Then I want all those who've acted against their oath to protect the Constitution
(in all branches of government) to be ousted and prosecuted.

Then I want to restore a free press (at all regional levels, from local to
national, to worldwide), accountable only to their dedication to truth and
transparency, protected from monied influences.

And I want to inspire a worldwide conversation about what kind of peace we want
to protect world-wide, and give voices to all who want to be heard

Then it's time to get money out of politics, starting with repeal of
"Citizens United"
