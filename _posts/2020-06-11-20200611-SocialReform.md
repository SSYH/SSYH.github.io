title: Structural Social Reform
---

Once money was allowed to rule, too soon it became evident that most
politicians turned AWAY from the citizenry and TOWARD the money
teat.It's a single-party system: the party of the monied elite, with 2
faces for us to "believe" it's a 2-party system. This con was so well
executed most of us have been asleep thinking justice was being
served.

[Money Corrupts](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse2.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.PpaPIv7m60LViNS_aH_5WgHaEK%26pid%3DApi&f=1)


The DNC's actions the last 4+ years (and probably longer, tho less
visible) betray their charter of identifying and supporting good
candidates for national leadership. It went out of its way to remove
the best candidate for citizens' rights: Bernie Sanders, because he
threatened the power of money. 

The GOP is smugly and blatantly carefree in its abandonment of the
citizenry, knowing they have the power to do so with impunity.

THIS is what we must dismantle and replace.

It must start with transparency and respect / pursuit of truth and
justice. It must ENFORCE the Constitution and its guarantees if we are
to be a just nation.

Therefore, restoration of a free press, elimination of unreasonable
money influences, prosecution of corruption, nepotism, dismantling of
the BIG-X, complete and visible tracking of money flows, are all
necessary.

This list will probably grow as I update this post.
