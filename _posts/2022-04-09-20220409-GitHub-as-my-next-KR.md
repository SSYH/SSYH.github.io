title: GitHub As My Next Knowledge Repository
---

After trying a few content repositories, and because a DKR (or DDKR) hasn't yet been built,
I will try using GitHub.com as my NEXT knowledge repository.

GitHub is THE PLACE where the best large-scale technical collaboration happens, and has been
where collaborative practices have emerged and been refined, so I will adopt it and see how it works.

I know it will be difficult for some to collaborate with me there, but one of Doug's principles is the HS-TS CoEvolution model, where our skills and practices need to grow as technology affords us new capabilities that require (or at least strongly suggest) we learn new skills and operational models in order to effectively apply and leverage those new technologies.

So I've created (and shown last week) a GCC organization at GitHub.com, and seeded it with 2 repos to start (the proposal submission, and the 9 Artifacts blog writeup.)

Today I will create one or 2 additional repos.
