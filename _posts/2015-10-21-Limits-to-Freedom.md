title: Limits to Freedom
---

While we all have come to appreciate some degree of freedom as
foundational to pursuit of happiness, we have accepted some limits to
freedom in order that a fair and safe society be sustainable and
accommodate all of us.  Some of these limits are those we choose to
abide by in order that we not create chaos:

* You cannot yell “Fire” in a crowded facility, eg. theatre
* You cannot cause harm or loss to others
