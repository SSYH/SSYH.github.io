Today's GCC Saturday Barn Raising / Foundation Laying session was mine
to (1) bring focus, and (2) moderate to achieve focus, so that we
could (3) cocreate together. So I brought my interest in
intergenerational communication, collaboration, involvement,
engagement, connection, etc. eventually sharing my [**Teen Congress**
blog from 6/16](2020-06-16-20200616-TeenCongress.md).

A number of very helpful and (I took to be) enthusiastic and
supportive suggestions were provided:

* Kayla: UN Teen
* Thys: Hague
* Colin:
* Stacey: 2 in their 20's
