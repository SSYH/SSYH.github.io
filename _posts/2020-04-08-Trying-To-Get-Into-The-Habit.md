title: Trying to Get Into the Habit

So at first, I was really enthusiastic to get onto Jekyll, but then I read that it's making way for more "modern" packages... not yet sure about that. I'll probably try this out for a while anyway.

Ideally, whatever replaces Jekyll will have an up/side-grade path to it *from* Jekyll
