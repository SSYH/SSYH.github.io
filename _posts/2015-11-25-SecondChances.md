It’s too simplistic to say “s/he broke a promise so we’re done”. Or is it?

Is a simple break of a promise sufficient grounds to break off a
relationship? What if I know that s/he is going through tremendous
healing, learning the habits that s/he never learned growing up? What
if that person didn’t have the parenting that was absent through the
formative and crucial pre-teen, teen, and early adulthood years? What
if that person was on their own because they’d been forced to cope
with all of life’s challenges themselves from an early age?  What if
one recognizes that person is struggling to learn these habits, but
isn’t perfect? How many second chances is enough? Is it good to give
more chances? Does this compromise my own integrity? Am I still
helping if I recognize forward progress, even though it’s of the
“2-steps forward, 1-step backward” variety? What does “I’m only human”
really mean? Is it an excuse? Is it a valid recognition of
imperfection? When does that trump a promise? What does “Sorry” really
mean? …
