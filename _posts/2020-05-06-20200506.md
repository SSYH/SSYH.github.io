title: more GoDaddy frustration
---


My "Premium" mail subscription at GoDaddy expired today; Nick couldn't
get into his email, so pinged me around noon. Got it resolved, after
checking that the domain was still ok. But when GoDaddy support
"transferred" the live mail accounts to the NEW premium "UNLIMITED"
package, I still get told I'm over my storage allocation!!!
Arrggghhhhh
