Haven't yet figured out a good workflow for this github-based blogging
habit. Some of my as-yet-unsettled-ruminations has to do with how I
distinctify the blog domains of
1. Personal
1. PFTF / GCC and
1. Work / professional...
1. and Miscellaneous thoughts go

20200501 update: OK so
1. This place (Jekyll on Github.io) can be for PFTF / GCC / Amigos / KF / COI thoughts.
1. My own stuff will go in Workflowy.
1. Work stuff will go
into work Confluence.
