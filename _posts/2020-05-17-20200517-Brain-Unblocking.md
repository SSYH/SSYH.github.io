title: Experimented with the Brain for Today's Unblocking
---

I atttended today's unblocking with 2 interesting aspects that hadn't
previously applied.

* Stacia Scoggins contacted me yesterday with an interest in the Zoom
  meetings I'd previously invited Camano Island residents to
  participate in. Since those didn't happen, and she just recently
  again expressed interest, I invited her to today's Unblocking. She
  was fun to have in today's session, and she indicated she'd be back
  again.
* I wanted to see what I could do with [The GCC
  Brain](https://bra.in/8qwAgJ) to do some sense-making with today's
  conversation.

So after today's session, I took my notes (drafted as people spoke),
and tried to find some memes to create nodes from. I then linked those
meme nodes to the source of those ideas. I think even the little I did
can make the "feel" of today's conversation easier to convey to a
non-participant.

Here's [a snapshot of the node](https://bra.in/3pDQLn) about an hour
or 2 after I did this pass:

I look forward to feedback on how this "helps" or "lands" for
y'all. Also looking forward to talking to Jerry tomorow.
