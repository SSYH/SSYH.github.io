title: Sunday Air Clearing
---

I missed most of the unblocking session today, but checked in late,
and had a brief time with Joshua and Jaswinder that
1. cleared the
air between Joshua and me around last Saturday's "Fuck you" moment,
and
1. allowed me to confirm with both that Barn-Raising was still
headed toward the eventual GlobalSIM vision originally expressed in
December, 2009 (with Mike and Darla Hewitt, among others).

Agreements are necessary for aggregating the best of our observations,
data, information, knowledge, models, simulations, hypotheses,
strategies, visions, etc. and so for 3 years agreements have been one
of the core principles driving my exploration in GCC.

More later on this...
