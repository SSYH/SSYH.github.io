I missed most of the unblocking session today, but checked in late,
and had a brief time with Joshua and Jaswinder that
1 cleared the
air between Joshua and me around last Saturday's "Fuck you" moment,
and
1 allowed me to confirm with both that Barn-Raising was still
headed toward the eventual GlobalSIM vision originally expressed in
December, 2009 (with Mike and Darla Hewitt, among others).
