Recalled from 2012 October 27:

I had a very unusual dream last night. 

I found myself very aware of the surroundings (in the dream), but yet knowing that in my real life, I was sleeping comfortably in bed. The dream was very vivid, I found myself questioning (in the dream) whether I was dreaming, and concluding that I really WAS dreaming, yet the colors, faces, details, physics, lighting... were quite and astonishingly convincing. At one point, I was gripping the metal grate on a window, and it was hard and unyielding, yet since I KNEW I was in a dream, I said "Then I must be able to Matrixly tear this grate apart, right?", and then proceeded to do so! Turning around, I saw a large window, and said "Now I will fly", and flew through the window and into the air outside, looking down at the streets, buildings, lights, etc. below, and following a street for several blocks while above it all. 

I don't remember much else, but this was unlike any other dream I've ever had.
