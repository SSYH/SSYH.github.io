I started the session, but then fell asleep, but when I woke up, I
heard long periods of back and forth arguing between Jaswinder and
Colin...

So I got up to let Gaia out :) 
and found a pile of poop near the back door... :( 

Ronni had made me a cool whipped coffee, so that was refreshing :) 

After 3 hours, today's GCC video STILL was not yet "processed" by Zoom.
