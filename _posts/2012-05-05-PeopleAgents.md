title: Agents, People, and Collaboration
---

Just found this note / snippet from 8 years ago; must elaborate... 

* Agent: effect / create change.
* People: agents
* People: most powerful agents.
* People can create what they conceive.
* People can conceive much grander and magnificent than any other agents we are familiar with, other than nature.
* People with people: can be aligned, can be brownian, or can opposed
* ==> Collaboration

This post reminds me to come up with an object model for
collaborology. The above items are a barely detectable start. Must do
MUCH elaboration.
