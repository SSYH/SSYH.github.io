There are lots of places one (I) can appear on the net.

Google looks like a reasonably persistent place, so until they look
like they’re getting rid of gDocs, I’ll use this place to AUTHOR blog
entries, and then post them to those various places.

> Note: Since this was originally written in 2015, I've since tried a number of platforms. Currently (2020), I'm trying Jekyll on Github.io

I will write and revise blogs HERE. For now. (meaning Google, as of 20151017:1749)

As of 20200505: I will use Jekyll on Github.io, with address [SuperSammetry.com](http://SuperSammetry.com)

Places where I put things:
* **Workflowy.com** (my life is here now)
* **Google Docs** (start here, authoritative. All others derive from this source, until otherwise specified)
* **KFJournal.org** (published as specific blog entries, categorized as per kfj site categories)
* **Collaborology.info** (an eventual public-facing resource on collaborology)
* Collaborology.com (ex-collaborapology.com - Sam’s blog presence)
* Facebook notes (occasionally)
* **CommunityofImpact.info** (the COI one-pager, started here in 2013… will bring it back to relevance)
* **Socialtext.net** (long ago.. no longer used, but lots of stuff still there, mostly just personal now)
* **SoundCloud** (many Amigos audio files. Link to these from articles / blogs)
* **Archive.org** (Some Amigos audio files)
* **Knowledgefederation.org** (Dino uses this…)
* **DebateGraph.org** (I’d LIKE to use this more)

Will have to map this out, and make sense out of this; it right now doesn't hang together nicely.
