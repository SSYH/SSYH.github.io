title: Sunday Unblocking

I triggered Amanda when I was addressing Unblocking sharing practices
and the use of "I" and "me" vs "We", "You", and "Us". I highlighted
that learning from each other COULD beneficially incorporate "you, we,
etc" and that connecting from HEART was good, but connecting on
MULTIPLE chakras (including 7, 1, 2, etc) could (imho) be even
better. And that we had spent enough time together that I occasionally
PRESUME that HEART connection and respect is a given. Perhaps that's
mistaken.

THEN discussing IDEAS and meta topics can be valid. This point didn't
resonate with all. (Some, but not all)
