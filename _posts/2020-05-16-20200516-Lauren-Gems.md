title: Lauren and Gems and Miro
---

Lauren moderated today, and brought the topic of harvesting "Gems"
from conversations.  (That's my understanding, but I'm willing to be
corrected.)

Welcome to Kayla Ancheta Chey, whom I met for the first time today,
though she says she's attended a couple previous GCC sessions.

Also, welcome back, Charles! Haven't seen you in a while :)

I don't know anything about Miro other than what Lauren presented
today, but it looked easy to use, and likely useful.  So I signed up
with FB SSO at miro.com. Here's an [invitation
link](https://miro.com/welcome/yLFy5R02aMoUUxefUd4PLUj5PFmRhkka6Ysyhw50gMENfGHGsosOlsmLYMRviZTy
) to join the GCC "real time board" at Miro.

re: "hitting a button" in real-time to record a gem: I think this is a
nice option / feature, but I would have to train myself to use
it. Culturally, some of us (I include myself) aren't prone to
"self-promotion" of the kind to say "What I'm about to say is a
**gem**, so it merits special-marking".

Frankly, if I don't think what I'm about to say is relevant and
significant, and worth noting, I'm likely to stay silent. So in one
sense, every time I speak, I'd in some sense want to hit the "gem"
button.

Next up, we have:
* Jaswinder, May 23
* Charles, May 30
* Joshua, Jun 6

Kayla said she would likely take a future session, and I'm also on
deck at some point.

More later...
