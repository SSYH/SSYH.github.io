title: I Will Blog (2018 Feb 04)
---

Keep in mind: this was written in 2018.

I’ve tried blogging before; it was a struggle:
* Do people care at all about what I think?
* Once I write something, am I liable for that thought forever?
* Perhaps I’m wrong…
* Suppose this blogging place goes away…?
* Is this the best place to put this?
…

So today, I’ve resolved to create my blog entries in the most
permanent place I know, and then use OTHER blogging presences for
“publishing” / “presenting” these blogs. 

Today, the most permanent place I know is Google. They’re big, and
they’re relatively open compared to other big places. And gDocs is a
minimally viable place to write :( ;)

I will NOT yet treat my blogs as PERMANENT. For now I will retain the
privilege and responsibility of updating my blogs if I feel they need
it, until a real DKR is available. They most always will need
updating, as I will write from what I know at time of writing. Later,
I am likely to have learned, and may choose to update my writing to
reflect that new understanding.

Commentary on my blogs will unfortunately be relevant to specific
versions / revisions of my blog entries. Hopefully, I choose blogging
places that understand versioning.

So this is my “coming out” blog entry :)
