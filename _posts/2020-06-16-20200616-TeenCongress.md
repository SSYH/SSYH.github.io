title: Teen Congress
---

I am enraged at the robbery being commited by this administration with
so-called "stimulus aid" legislation HIDING 500+ BILLION DOLLARS to
recipients unaccounted for, and with a smug refusal to be transparent
about this THEFT.

So Ronni and I were talking about this, or rather, she was listening
to me RANT about this, and she just shrugged: **Let teenagers run the
country**. 

THAT stopped me in my tracks. Since both Senate and the House are both
ineffective in helping the American family and citizens, THIS was akin
to my thoughts several years about when another 780+ BILLION dollars
was GIVEN to failed business models with the excuse that "it'll save
jobs". (cite reference to this)

So Ronni and I kicked around some ideas, and I think we're about to
launch Teen Congress. We are going to collect 435 teenagers (no one
over 20 need apply), and give them the issues of the day, and ask them
to advise governments on how to navigate through these issues.

BLM, MeToo, Social Security, Corruption, income disparity, etc. all
are eligible topics. 

We will need to do this in a good way. But the seed of an idea has
been planted. Now: on to the details.

Thoughts in progress: 

* 435 kids will comprise each Congress.  

* I would like each "Congress" to evolve its own rules (ideally
  inspired by the US Constitution), and be able to leverage the rules
  or learnings from OTHER groups to incorporate into its own.

* I would like each Congress to be transparent and explicit in its
  dealings. This includes rules, decisions, deliberations, memory,
  etc. Transparent and deliberate means making it available for ANYONE
  to view and understand.

* As many kids as want to participate WILL participate. They will be
  gathered (in some TBD way, probably randomly at first) into groups
  of 435.

  * Ideally, they will be collected proportionally according to the
    number of seats in the House as their state seats, but we will not
    be pedantic about this if it impedes going ahead and getting
    things done.

* I would like each "Congress" to critique the recommendations /
  "legislation" created by other Congress's in a transparent
  responsible manner.

* I can see specific topics given specific timeframes for deliberation, eg. 
  * Lynchings, BLM, Racism
  * Renewal energy
  * Food security
  * Corruption, Income disparity
  * Social Security

* I recommend the kids NOT get any outside "adult" help unless THEY
  REQUEST IT DIRECTLY.

* Sponsors may participate, but without influence on process or
  content. They may provide platforms for discussion:

  * I can think of Slack, Teams, Asana, Facebook, Loomio, Kumu,
    TheBrain, Atlassian, etc. offering their platforms.

  * I can see Microsoft, Apple, YouTube, Google, etc. offering their
    tools.

* Would like to feature each proposal in interviews.
