title: Teen Congress
---

I am livid at the robbery being commited by this administration with
so-called "stimulus aid" legislation HIDING 500+ BILLION DOLLARS
unaccounted for, and with a smug refusal to be transparent about this
THEFT.

So Ronni and I were talking about this, or rather, she was listening
to me RANT about this, and she just shrugged: Let teenagers run the
country. THAT stopped me in my tracks. Since both Senate and the House
are both ineffective in helping the American family and citizens, THIS
was akin to my thought years about when another 780+ BILLION dollars
was GIVEN to failed business models with the excuse that "it'll save
jobs".

So Ronni and I kicked around some ideas, and I think we're about to
launch Teen Congress. We are going to collect 435 teenagers (no one
over 20 need apply), and give them the issues of the day, and ask them
to advise governments on how to navigate through these issues.

BLM, MeToo, Social Security, Corruption, income disparity, etc. all
are eligible topics. 

We will need to do this in a good way. But the seed of an idea has
been planted. Now: on to the details.

Thoughts in progress: 

* 435 kids will comprise each Congress.  

* As many kids as want to participate WILL participate. They will be
  gathered (in some TBD way, probably randomly at first) into groups
  of 435.

* Sponsors may participate, but without influence. They may provide
  platforms for discussion 

  * I can think of Slack, Teams, Asana, Facebook, etc. offering their
    platforms.

  * I can see Microsoft, Apple, YouTube, etc. offering their tools.

* I recommend the kids NOT get any outside "adult" help unless THEY
  REQUEST IT DIRECLY.
