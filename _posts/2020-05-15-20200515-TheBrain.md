title: TheBrain is Back In My Life (for now)
---

I broke down ;) and bought another year subscription to
[TheBrain](http://thebrain.com) even though I had data loss a few
years ago. I want to help TheBrain team continue to develop TheBrain,
and today, buying their product seems to be one way.

So I'm recreating, and sharing, the following brains, ALL
WORKS-IN-PROGRESS. Unfortunately (as was also previously the
limitation), team collaboration takes MORE $$$ to enable. If there's
enough interest in this, perhaps we could start a GoFundUs ;) or
Patreon, and then use TheBrain to collaborate.

My WIP Brains are:
### [Collaborology:](https://bra.in/7p6ZAP)

Let me know if you have problems seeing these online brains. Also let
me know if there are connections you'd like to collaborate on with me.

I'm currently paying $159/year for this subscription. 

I believe [TeamBrain is
$299/year/PERSON](https://thebrain.com/store/compare-editions).  If I
find EVEN ONE person (you?) who wants to collaborate on this with me,
I'm willing to upgrade my subscription to the TEAM version so that we
can do so. (It also means YOU will also need this level of
subscription, according to current TheBrain pricing.)
