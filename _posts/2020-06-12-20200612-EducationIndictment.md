title: Indictment of Education "System"
---

I can't think of a greater indictment of our "education system" than
that it produced a population that voted in a sorry excuse of a human
being to the presidency (putting aside the "election rigging" issue).

We see millions spent on athletic facilities, coaches, marketing,
etc. And barely thousands spent on recognizing intellectual or
humanistic contributions. Schools get enormous identity and
recognition via their sports teams, but the number of people who could
cite intellectual, artistic, philanthropic, or other socially
uplifting acts or individuals is miniscule in comparison. 

And what is taught in sports? TO WIN!? Yeah... I know there are good
coaches who emphasize sportsmanship, teamwork, etc. and those are
good. But we also hear all too often about "win at all costs", esp in
the zero-sum model of WIN OR LOSE... Don't be a loser! Those who stop
to help a fellow runner dehydrated by distance are recognized in
memes, but the millions go to those who DO NOT STOP TO HELP.

What recognition do GOOD TEACHERS get? Bad teachers still get
tenure. Good teachers get admonished by administrations afraid of
innovation and community expectations.

The values we teach BY ACTION are what are learned by students. I saw
growing up the being a good student was NOT NEARLY VALUED as much as
being good looking, or being a good athlete.
