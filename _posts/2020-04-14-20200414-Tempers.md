title: Reflections on Saturday's Barn Raising Session
---

Saturday's GCC Barn Raising session saw a number of people express
their tempers and interrupt each other, more frequently than we are
used to.

Jaswinder definitely encouraged the expressions of "direct"
disagreements, and I think that catalyzed a number of such strong
reactions.

After one observation *I* made myself regarding whether our experiment
on FOCUS was proceeding Joshua chimed in with a "F**k You" and quick
departure.

I'll have to review this session again to ask myself:
* Could we have prevented this?
* Should I have prevented this?
* Did we learn anything?
