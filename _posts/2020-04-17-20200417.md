title: Clojure Wrapper for JFreeSane
---

I found a reference to JFreeSane library (via a YouTube video when
looking for other users of gscan2pdf).  I want to get familiar with
this library, as it could be something I could use.  In particular, I
was curious whether someone had created a Clojure app based on this
library.

A quick search suggests not.  This could be nice project for me:
Create a Clojure app using JFreeSane, so that I can

* Get more familiar with Clojure
* Contribute to open source, github
* Leverage my scanner / document management background
* Have a scanning app that maps to my ideal workflow

Something for me to consider. :)
