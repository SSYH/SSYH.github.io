title: Tweach - The Idea
---

Tweach is an experiment in crowdsourcing life lessons, HOWTO’s,
etc. and an attempt to leverage “big data” to come up with how we can
guide ourselves and our next generations, based on what previous
generations have learned and passed on. It’s an attempt to use Twitter
(mostly, though other social media forums could work as well) to share
what we learned when.

### Proposed Hashtags:

* #WhenIwas1
* #WhenIwas2
* #WhenIwas3
…
* #WhenIwas29
...
* #WhenIwasInMy20’s
* #WhenIwasInMy30’s
* #WhenIwasInMy40’s
* #WhenIwasInMy50’s
…
* #WhenIGraduatedHS
* #WhenIGotBS
* #WhenIGotBA
* #WhenIGotMS
* #WhenIGotMA
* #WhenIGotPhD
* #WhenIGotFired
* #WhenIGotHired
* #WhenIGotMarried
* #WhenIGotDivorced
* #WhenMyDogDied
* #WhenMyWifeDied
* #WhenMy…
* #WhenI...
… lots to be defined

Each of us posts what we learned, with one of these tags. Once enough
of us do this, there’s lots to be done with “big data” and pattern
analysis to compile very interesting complement to
“wikipedia”. Obviously this grows and morphs over time and
contributions.
