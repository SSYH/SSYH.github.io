A **reputation system** would be nice if it:
* recognized PRE-DEPLOYMENT value in addition to POST-DEPLOYMENT value; 
else it is ready for first-mover advantage and gaming
* couldn't be gamed, or at least had a method where gaming it 
could be easily detected & rectified
* recognized MULTIPLE modes of contribution, 
not just profit, or time, or connection, or...
* allowed the LONG-EXTENDED-EFFORT that goes into some breakthroughs, 
and not just transactional for short or instantaneous transactions...
* the object being acknowledged (transaction, talk, donation, support, action, etc) 
would be recorded in its raw form, SEPARATE and distinct 
from the "reputation" component of the "ledger entry";
* the object remaining immutable, but augmentable, and
* the "reputation" component evolving over time, not static
* more later

These thoughts first collected in response to a 
[FB post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GlobalChallengesCollaboration/permalink/1264369260427146/) 
from Angus Joseph, and response from Aaron Perlmutter.
