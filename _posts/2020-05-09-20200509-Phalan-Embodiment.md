title: Phalan brings "Embodiment" as Focus
---

Phalan brought "**embodiment**" as a focus.

His focusing question was "If you were to identify with anything that
has a form, outside of your physical form, and connect with it, what
would that look like to you?"

I tried to connect embodiment with senses, information, connectivity /
connection, control, sensitivity, openness, receptivity, meaning,
learning, being, living, doing, action... along with a dynamic view of
divergence - contraction... a kind of heartbeat rhythm of living.

That receptivity can be stimulated by immersion in novelty; another
way is to go DEEP, as did Buddha, Andrew Weill, and other such
examples of **introspection**, vs external stimulation.

Didn't quite toss in the simplicity, patience, compassion triad...

Early in the session was an oblique reference to Chuang-Tzu's theme of
the dreamer and the butterfly.
