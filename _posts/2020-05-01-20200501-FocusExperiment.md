title: Focus Experiment
---

A few weeks ago (I'll look up when) in a Barn Raising session, I heard
again an oft-repeated refrain that we were having trouble focusing and
getting things done. I've been trying to balance focus on a path I
have in my mind with the exploration of what naturally comes up that
is of interest to session participants.

So I proposed an experiment: that each BR regular (or at least those
in that particular session) be given an opportunity to take a
particular Saturday, and do 2 things:
1. Bring a topic that s/he wants the group to focus on
1. Take on moderation responsibility for that session, and utilize
whatever techniques, practices, guidelines, tools, etc. that the
person believes can assist in bringing that focus

This would be the first part of these Saturday experiments. The close
of the session (30-45 min) I would lead a "reflection" or
"retrospective" on how that session went. In particular, my interest
was
1. Did the group feel focus was achieved?
1. Did the moderator effectively utilize experience, techniques,
etc. in order to achieve that focus?
1. Did the group effectively collaborate / cocreate around that focus?

Either in updates to this post, or in later posts, I'll post reflections on the
sessions that have already been held.

Next 2 sessions:
1. Saturday May 2: Eric Rangell
2. Saturday May 9: Phalan Morelife
