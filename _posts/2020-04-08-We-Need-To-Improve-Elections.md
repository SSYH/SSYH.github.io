title: We Need to Improve Elections
---

Can we build a TRANSPARENT voting infrastructure that's
blockchain-based, incorruptible, by October?  Let's call it Vote-B.

I'm not asking for it to be adopted by the powers-that-be; I'm
claiming that if some significant percentage of us vote in the
"system" - the "official" Vote-A *and* we also Vote-B, we can show how
the people really think and vote.

I'm going to give this some thought.  Who wants to work on this with
me?

Let's create the "Linux" of voting systems.
