title: What to Post Where
---

Haven't yet figured out a good workflow for this github-based blogging
habit.  Some of my as-yet-unsettled-ruminations has to do with how I
distinctify the blog domains of (1) personal (2) PFTF/GCC and (3)
work/professional... and then also: where do (4) miscellaneous
thoughts go?

20200501 update: OK so
1 this place can be for PFTF / GCC / Amigos / KF
/ COI thoughts.
1 My own stuff will go in Workflowy.
1 Work stuff will go
into work Confluence.
