title: Need a TRANSPARENT Incorruptible Voting System
---

On a Facebook status this morning, I proposed a TRANSPARENT voting
system that would address some of the issues that rub me the wrong way
(but hard!) from the current cesspool that is American politics. Lack
of integrity, blatant lying, blatang corruption & nepotism, complete
disregard for the health of the citizenry by both Biden AND Trump, and
to sadly face that Bernie is defocusing ont he campaign in favor or
raising support for the unfortunate people who are having a hard time
through this covid crisis. The world just doesn't appreciate honest
sincere well-intentioned man like Bernie. They'd rather have 2 rapists
on the ballot.
