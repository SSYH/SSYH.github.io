title: Still trying to understand Jekyll and URIs and filenames
---

Just tried renaming every file to "yyyy-mm-dd-yyyymmdd.md" but though
I see these renames reflected at github.com, Jekyll is still producing
the old URIs with the old filenames. I've been waiting 65-70 seconds
after push to github, which usually is enough. Still need to
understand this framework.

Several minutes later: Well... it just took longer. Curiously some
updates will happen in 65-70 seconds, but others take several times
longer....??
