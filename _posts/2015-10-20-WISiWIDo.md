title: What is WISiWIDo?
---

**WISiWIDo** (aka WYSiWYDo) is the infrastructure (tooling,
applications, protocols, practices, principles,...) to support
atomic-level collaboration: The 2-person agreement. WYSIWYDo is
intended to scale from this micro-level to macro-level collaboration
at global scale.

* WISiWIDo incorporates a basic state model for collaborative interactions. It is simple, but extensible. 
* WISiWIDo proposes a basic foundational protocol for negotiating (exploring, requesting, confirming, executing, confirming, closing) action items.
* WISiWIDo incorporates an extension model whereby it can integrate seamlessly with other applications and services. It will be embeddable as it is extensible.
* WISiWIDo will be available on the web, as well as on mobile devices in order to always be available to support collaborative interactions.

Much more to be added hereâ€¦ This is just a placeholder start.
