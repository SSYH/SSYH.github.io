Eric brought [TheBrain](http://thebrain.com) to HIS Barn Raising /
Foundation Laying (Pouring) session today. Was good! More later.

### 202005042200 update: 
Years ago, I had tried, and liked very much, The
Brain. I had organized my calendar with it. Many of my projects were
fleshed out with it. I'd been scanning documents and throwing away the
paper, attaching them to Brain nodes. UNTIL.... One day I lost half my
brain. I don't know how. It was not pleasant. I've stayed away ever
since.

But now... with the belief that TheBrain may have worked out whatever
issues it had with data loss, and synchronization, and that other GCC
friends are re-interested in TheBrain, based on Eric's introduction to
it... I am now seriously considering trying TheBrain again. I called
them a few days ago to ask what my upgrade cost would be, so now
understand that. Next step is to just do it...
