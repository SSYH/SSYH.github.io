title: Found Feb 23 session
---

I looked on my 8TB backup drive where I'd moved files when my Red
Tower was going unstable... and found the Feb 23 files there. Uploaded
to YT, but still waiting for the automatic transcript to be produced.

That leaves Mar 09, and then the trims for Apr 19 and May 03.

Hours later: The transcript was up pretty quickly this time, so got
the 20200223 announcement up not long afterward.

However, I've run out of places to look for hte 0309 video... I have
checked all the machines I think I own (about 8)... and don't see it
anywhere (yet).
