title: Found Feb 23 session
---

I looked on my 8TB backup drive where I'd moved files when my Red
Tower was going unstable... and found the Feb 23 files there. Uploaded
to YT, but still waiting for the automatic transcript to be produced.

That leaves Mar 09, and then the trims for Apr 19 and May 03.
