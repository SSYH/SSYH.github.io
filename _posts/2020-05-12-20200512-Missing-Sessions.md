title: Weather is phenomenally beautiful

The breeze through open windows and doors is so soft and
caressing... and the sun so warm these days (other than a short patch
of drizzles)... this really is heaven on earth. Cool air... carrying
away stress effectively!!

Turns out a couple of past UNBLOCKING sessions went QUITE LONG and I
departed before they ended. However, it seems on a couple of
occasions, I didn't pass HOST to someone, so the recording kept going
until I got back to terminate it. I tried to upload them as is/was, but
YT complains that they are too long (not recognizing the tail hours
were uneventful), so I will have to trim them here locally before
uploading. PITA.

> FTR: The 2 sessions affected are Apr 19 and May 03.

look harder. 

I've got more and more details to work through and to document into a
HOWTO for handling videos (as I currently do; always open to
improvement and incorporating assistance)
